I need to add the ability to add Something to the title based on the values of 

$TypeValue and $SplitSource $Get Variables 

and then 

$TypeValue and $PackagedSource $Get Variables


If
the Get String has 
Type=Air-Conditioner
and
Split-Source=Natural-Gas
then I need to add " + Gas Furnace" to the title

If
the Get String has 
Type=Air-Conditioner
and
Split-Source=Electric
then I need to add " + Air Handling Unit" to the title

If
the Get String has 
Type=Heat-Pump
and
Split-Source=Electric
then I need to add " + Air Handling Unit" to the title

If
the Get String has 
Type=Heat-Pump
and
Split-Source=Natural-Gas
then I need to add " + Gas Furnace" to the title

If
the Get String has 
Type=Packaged-Unit
and
Split-Source=Natural-Gas
then I need to add " + Gas Heat" to the title

If
the Get String has 
Type=Packaged-Unit
and
Split-Source=Electric
then I need to add " + Electric Heat" to the title
